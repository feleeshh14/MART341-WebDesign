universal, element, class, id selectors: A univeral selector is when you need to style every element on one page. Class selectors are used when you group elements together into an assigned class to style them. Element and id selectors are used when you need to style specific elements. You can adjust an element in html and/or you can assign an id to them to use in css to style them. For my color palette, I initially wanted to go with my favorite colors which are purple and yellow and I wasn't sure what content to use and then I remembered I recently came across a gorgeous fish that was yelllow and purple at the Iron Horse in their aquarium. I fugured it was a good route to go since the colors compliment each other so well. I mainly struggled this week because I wanted to do more styling than I know how to so I wasn't completly satified with my work. I did learn a lot and I am loooking forward to learning more!
