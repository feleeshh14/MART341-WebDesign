This assignment was defintely time consuming but also necessary. It gave me the opoortunity to explore all of my new skills at once and put different elements together. It was very helpful to work through each page because it's helping me remember how to use everything I've learned and get into a routine of checking my work as I go, etc. As I was working through making this website, I also learned how to pair different elemnts to get deisred results. For an example, I struggled with turning the vertical bar in the navigation bar to a font color that matched the other text and I was able to get it to work by using the <span> element. I am excited to continue learning new things that will help me be able to be more creative with styling.
