        Alea Lovely created the podcast, <i>Spiritual Shit</i>, five years <br />
        ago to cultivate a community that is able to learn about their spirituality <br />
        and one another. She opens up the space to scientists, religious/spiritual  <br />
        leaders, entrepreneurs, and anyone with knowledge to share to the collective.
