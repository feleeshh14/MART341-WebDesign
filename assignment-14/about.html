             I started tattooing in Portland, Oregon in 2015 and worked at a few shops there until moving to Missoula in 2021. Being from North Dakota I was ready to leave the city and move closer to my hometown, but without going all the way back to ND. Having many friends all around western MT has made the transition smooth and working at MTC has allowed me to generate a wonderful clientele in a short time.

             Some of my favorite things to tattoo are flowers, animals, nature and botanical things, your pet's cute face, mandalas, art nouveau elements, anything cute, etc. bonus points if you get a couple of those subjects together. I would describe my tattooing style as illustrative/neo-traditional. I very much believe in a black outline around every tattoo, I promise it keeps your tattoo looking better for a longer period of time. I favor some good black shading but like to use fine detail lines to make your tattoo more dynamic. I have no preferences between black and grey or color tattoos; it's on your body so that is up to your style preferences. My range goes from dark black everything to bright bubblegum cuteness, both of them are equally fun for mean present their own quirks.

             For me, tattoos are a chance to decorate and stylize your skin. I strive to do tattoos that make my clients feel beautiful in their own skin, and I love when a new tattoo turns self-consciousness into self confidence, and if that means redecorating part of your body with a new piece then you are in the right place! I tattoo all bodies and all skin tones and I hope to make your tattoo experience as welcoming and as comfortable as possible.
             <br />
             <br />
             Outside of tattooing, I paint, draw, and craft lots of subjects but I seem to always drift back to Mother Nature as inspiration. My favorites are birds, bugs, and plants, but I amm always down to draw any critter you would like! I also spend time gardening and doing all sorts of outdoor activities with my partner Derek, as well as spending plenty of time cuddling with my two kitties, Blueberry and Loui. We are all very excited to be in Missoula and I am so happy to be tattooing here with the great crew at MTC.

             Remember, tattoos are forever and for me to ensure it lasts as long as you do we need to make it sturdy and that's where the black comes in. Every tattoos ages and changes with the body so I want to give you the best tattoo I can given my knowledge of that process. Always protect your tattoos with sunscreen, the sun is your tattoo's worst enemy in terms of fading as well the general aging of your skin. Tattoos cost time and money so we don't want a couple of sunny summers to negate all that hard work! I am happy to answer any and all tattoo questions if you have them. I hope you like my work and feel so inclined to set up an appointment.
