Directories are what we use to see the structure and folders are within specific directories to help with organization. VCS are useful to help us track, evaluate, and enhance our work indidually as well as with others. My favorite artist medium is painting. I am involved in many mediums with my current job and find the most theraputic and addictive medium to be painting.
