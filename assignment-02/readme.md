I am wondering if I am supposed to reguarly update the readme file anytime I make changes? I know VCS will track all changes made but from my basic understanding of read me files is they are supposed to explain what is in the folder. For this week, I learned about file directories, readme files, and markdown language. I created a new folder called assignent 2, within that folder I created a responses.txt to respond to this week's questions, uplaoded a screenshot of my work, and am now working on the readme file for this specific assingment. I don't have any speciifc questions this week but I am still learning how to navigate github so I am sure I will have some bubble up. I have struggled navigating between so many new platforms but I am sure it will get easier with time.
